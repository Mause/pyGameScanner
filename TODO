CS Server Finder ->
    > Make code compatible with pypy
    > Improve Latency tracking system to give more accurate result
    > Change pinging logic to ping different subnets at each funcation call in a loop
    this will ensure that we don't run out of send buffer size and drop packets

    server, also possible identify bots and show them as bots on the web page
